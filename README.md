# Agora of Experts (AoE)

## Introduction
Agora of Experts is an innovative chatbot platform that redefines the boundaries of automated conversations. Unlike traditional chatbots that operate within strict parameters, AoE offers a liberating experience where interactions are not confined to a single model or a rigid script. Users have the unique ability to direct questions to different AI models within the same conversation (Experts), enabling a dynamic and multi-faceted dialogue like in an Agora.

The platform's standout feature is its flexibility; users can activate and deactivate various tools, RAG Collections or reflection algorithms for each question, enhancing the chatbot's responses based on the conversation's context or the userâ€™s specific needs without the need to restart the conversation. This enhances interactions and provides tailored responses, making each conversation with AoE a distinct and adaptable experience.

AoE is designed for users seeking a more engaging, personalized, and versatile chatbot experience, perfect for both casual queries and complex discussions.
